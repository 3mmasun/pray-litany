# Litany of Trust

*Written by **Sr. Faustina Maria Pia**, SV - *SISTERS OF LIFE**


From the belief that I have to earn Your love
> *Deliver me, Jesus. (repeat after each petition)*

From the fear that I am unlovable

From the false security that I have what it takes

From the fear that trusting You will leave me more destitute

From all suspicion of Your words and promises

From the rebellion against childlike dependency on You

From refusals and reluctances in accepting Your will

From anxiety about the future

From resentment or excessive preoccupation with the past

From restless self-seeking in the present moment

From disbelief in Your love and presence

From the fear of being asked to give more than I have

From the belief that my life has no meaning or worth

From the fear of what love demands

From discouragement

That You are continually holding me, sustaining me, loving me
> *Jesus, I trust in You. (repeat after each petition)*

That Your love goes deeper than my sins and failings and transforms me

That not knowing what tomorrow brings is an invitation to lean on You

That You are with me in my suffering

That my suffering, united to Your own, will bear fruit in this life and the next

That You will not leave me orphan, that You are present in Your Church

That Your plan is better than anything else

That You always hear me and in Your goodness always respond to me

That You give me the grace to accept forgiveness and to forgive others

That You give me all the strength I need for what is asked

That my life is a gift

That You will teach me to trust You

That You are my Lord and my God

That I am Your beloved one

Amen.
