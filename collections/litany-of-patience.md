# Litany of Humility

From the desire to control my life,

> Deliver me, O Jesus. (repeat after each petition)

From rash judgment and haste

From impulsive decision making

From the desire to act when I need to be still

From the desire to speak when I need to stay silent

From the delusion that my own ideas and plans are what would be best

From impatience with the sins and idiosyncrasies of others

From impatience with my own sins and slow growth in virtue

From impatience with Your plan for my life

From the desire to live on my own timeline

From the fear of running out of time

From the fear of aging and death

From the temptation to act out of sorrow, discouragement, anxiety, or fear

That I may wait upon your Word before making important decisions.
> Lord, teach me to trust your love. (repeat after each petition)

That I may not get ahead of or behind your Spirit.

That I may maintain an eternal perspective in all that I do.

That I may accept and surrender to your will for me daily.

That I may truly believe that ALL things work for the good of those who love you.

That I may radiate to others Your peace and joy which surpass all understanding.

Amen.
