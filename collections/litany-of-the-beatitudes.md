### Let us pray
Lord Jesus, light of the world,

you taught us how to be happy in this life and in the next, 

by walking in your blessed footsteps: make us humble, pure and merciful;

help us to make peace and pursue holiness, 

and to rejoice when we are persecuted, slandered, and insulted for your sake.

Illumine our hearts with your sacred teaching,

O Savior of the world, 

and form us as your devout disciples and the children of God your Father,

to the glory of your holy name.

Amen.
