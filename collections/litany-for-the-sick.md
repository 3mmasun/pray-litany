# Litany for the Sick

That all who are sick will be healed
> *Jesus, we trust in You*

That they find comfort and peace in Your heart

That they grow closer to You as they carry the heavy cross of illness

That people living with chronic pain find relief

That people suffering from mental illnesses find healing

That children who are ill be held by you

That their parents find faith and comfort in you

That families in hospitals feel your arms around them

That those in hospice have faith in your saving mercy

That those who care for the sick have your wisdom and strength

That we might love all who are sick as You love them

That people whose prayers have not yet been answered find peace

That those who will die from illness find eternal life in you
