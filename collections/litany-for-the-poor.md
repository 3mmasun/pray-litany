# Litany for the Poor

For our brothers and sisters trapped in the cycle of poverty
> *Deliver them, O God*

For those in slavery and human trafficking

For those trapped in unsafe situations

For those who are most vulnerable, especially children and the elderly

For those who struggle with mental illness

For those who suffer from addictions

For those without access to medicine or care

For those without access to quality education

For those seeking work

For whose unable to work

For those who can't afford basic necessities

For those who are looked down on because of their poverty

For those without shelter

For those who humble themselves to ask for help

For those who have given up hope

From the desire to control my life
> *Deliver me, O God*

From the desire for possessions

From the desire for wealth

From the desire for security

From the desire for praise and recognition

From the fear that God will ask more of me than I want to give

From the fear that if I give there will not be enough left for me

From the fear that I cannot make a difference

From the fear of spending time with those in poverty

From the temptation to not look beyong myself and my own family

From the temptation to not budget my giving

From the temptation to see others' suffering as not my problem

From the tempatation to believe I deserve what I've been given

In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit

Amen.
