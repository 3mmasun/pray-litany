# Litany for the Homeless

For those who live without homes or shelter
> *Shelter your people, Lord*

For children who are orphaned, unaccompanied, or without a permanent home

For immigrants who've left their homes

For refugees seeking asylum

For those who don't speak the language where they live

For those we see as strangers

For those who are treated without dignity

For those who are lonely or afraid

For those who don't feel at home in the Church

For those who do not have a spiritual home

For unborn children, still strangers to the world

For Humility to recognize our failures to serve
> *Lord, for this we ask*

For Open hearts, to welcome and receive

For Generosity, to give without counting the cost

For Grace to see all as our brothers and sisters in Christ

For Patience to keep serving, even when it's difficult

For Love to put the needs of those who suffer ahead of our own

For Wisdom to know how best to serve others

For Courage, to step outside what's comfortable

For Hope, that all may find a home

Amen.
