# Litany for the Dead

For all who have died
> *Lord, have mercy*

For all who will die today

For all who have died with no one to notice

For all who have died a sudden or violent death

For all whose deaths could have been prevented

For all who consider suicide today

For all children who have died

For all who mourn the loss of their children

For all who grieve the loss of a loved one

For all who have no one to pray for them

For all the souls in purgatory

From the fear of death
> *Deliver us*

From the neglect to prepare for our own deaths

From the love of this world over eternal life with you

From the temptations and sins that keep us away from you

From the rejection of your love and mercy

Eternal rest grant unto them O Lord, And let perpetual light shine upon them, May their souls and all the souls of the faithful departed through the mercy of God rest in peace

Amen.
