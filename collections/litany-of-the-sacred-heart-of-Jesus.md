Infinite Love,

You who first loved me,

You who commanded me to love you,

With all my heart,

With all my soul,

With all my mind,

With all my strength,

Above all possessions and honor,

Above all pleasures and enjoyments,

More than myself and all that belongs to me,

More than all my relatives and friends, 

More than all human beings and angels,

Above all created things in heaven and earth,

Only for yourself,

Because you are the Sovereign Good, 

Because you are the infinitely worthy of being loved, 

Because you are infinitely perfect, 

Even if you had not promised me heaven, 

Even if you had not warned me of hell,

Even if you try me by want and misfortune, 

In wealth and in poverty, 

In prosperity and in adversity, 

In health and in sickness, 

In life and in death, 

In time and in eternity, 

In union with that love by which all the saints and angels love you in heaven,

In union with that love by which the Blessed Virgin Mary loves you, 

In union with that love by which you love yourself eternally, 

You are just, O Lord, in all your ways, 

> And Loving in All Your Deeds.

Amen.
