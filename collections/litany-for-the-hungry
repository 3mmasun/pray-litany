# Litany for the Hungry

For those who woke up hungry today
> *Feed your people, O Lord*

For those who hunger today with their children

For those who hunger today alone

For those who hunger today at school or work

For those who hunger today in sickness

For those who hunger today as homeless

For those who hunger today and beg for help

For those who hunger today in my town

For those who hunger today in my country

For those who hunger today in our world

For those who hunger today for justice, peace and love

That I may feed your people today
> *Help us to serve as you, O Lord*

That I may open my home today

That I may add seats to my table today

That I will not turn a blind eye today

That I will fight for my brothers and sisters today

That I may support organizations feeding the hungry today

That I will see each meal as a gift today

That I will serve with your radical love today
